# Fork changes

Every way this fork diverges from upstream, why, and what to watch when
merging upstream back in.

Upstream is [clusterzx/ts6-manager](https://github.com/clusterzx/ts6-manager).
To diff against it directly:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/clusterzx/ts6-manager
git fetch upstream
git diff upstream/main...HEAD
```

## How this fork was reconstructed

The changes below were originally made in a ZIP download of the repository —
no git history, no branch. They were recovered by initialising a repository
over that folder, fetching the fork, and resetting the index to the commit the
ZIP came from so the edits surfaced as a diff.

That baseline is **`224bb7e`** (2026-08-06 03:02), identified by scoring every
commit in the history against the recovered tree; it differed in 38 files
where the next-best candidate differed in 71. The unmodified snapshot is
preserved on the branch `wip/local-changes`, whose single commit is the exact
ZIP contents. Nothing below is reconstructed from memory — each entry is a
hunk from that diff.

Two classes of difference in that diff were **not** carried forward, because
they were accidental rather than intended:

- **Reverted upstream features.** The ZIP predated several upstream commits in
  a way that showed up as deletions: `voice/lyrics.ts`, `discord/member-count.ts`,
  `utils/server-group-filter.ts` and `docs/recover-server-access.md`, plus the
  matching hunks in `discord-bridge.ts`, `embeds.ts`, `server-groups.routes.ts`
  and `Settings.tsx`. All are retained from upstream.
- **Dependency downgrades.** `tar`, `axios` and `postcss` were moved backwards
  and four pnpm overrides (`brace-expansion@1`, `brace-expansion@5`,
  `ip-address`, `postcss`) removed. Those pins were added upstream in `960c5ff`
  to close npm audit advisories, 14 minutes before the ZIP's baseline. Upstream
  versions are kept.

The fork was then rebased onto current `main`, which brings in the 2026-08-06
security release (`91a483f`): the MFA bypass via JWT token-class confusion,
yt-dlp argument injection, unauthenticated WebSocket, and the unguarded reads.
**The fork had been running without those fixes.**

## Divergences

### Hardware video encoding (VP9 on VAAPI)

| | |
|---|---|
| Commits | `feat(sidecar): encode VP9 on Intel VAAPI…`, `build(compose): pass the host GPU…` |
| Files | `packages/sidecar/main.go`, `Dockerfile.sidecar`, `docker-compose*.yml` |

Upstream encodes VP8 with libvpx on the CPU, which saturates a core at 1080p30.
This fork encodes VP9 on the Intel GPU.

The codec appears in **three places that must agree**, or the stream negotiates
one format and carries another:

1. `MediaEngine.RegisterCodec` — `MimeTypeVP9`, payload type 98
2. `NewTrackLocalStaticRTP` — the local track's codec capability
3. FFmpeg's `-payload_type`

Encoding is now selected from the web UI rather than hardcoded. `encoders.go`
declares each profile once — codec, payload type, encoder name, pixel format,
FFmpeg flags — and all three codec sites derive from that record. `GET
/capabilities` probes `ffmpeg -encoders` so the UI can distinguish a profile
this host can run from one it merely knows about, and a profile the host
cannot run falls back to the software encoder for the same codec.

**Partly-resolved regression.** The per-peer keyframe gate is applied again
when VP8 is the active codec. `isVP8KeyframeStart` still cannot read VP9, so a
VP9 stream opens the gate on the first packet and a viewer joining mid-frame
may see artefacts until the next keyframe. **Follow-up: write a VP9 keyframe
detector.**

Deployment depends on `/dev/dri` passthrough *and* group membership for the
unprivileged `sidecar` user — see the comments in `docker-compose.yml`.

Known-good reference: a UGREEN NASync DXP4800 Plus running this fork in
production since 2026-08, with `devices: /dev/dri:/dev/dri` and
`group_add: "105"` (the `render` group on that host — check yours with
`stat -c '%g' /dev/dri/renderD128`, it is not the same number everywhere).
VP9 hardware encoding works there for both IPTV and YouTube sources.

### A/V pacing removed

| | |
|---|---|
| Commit | `perf(sidecar): stop pacing RTP forwarding by track timestamp` |
| Files | `packages/sidecar/main.go` |

`processVideoRTP` and `processAudioRTP` no longer sleep against
`computeTrackDelay` before forwarding each new timestamp.

**Rationale unknown.** This was changed during the VP9 port and the author does
not recall why; the plausible reading is that encoder latency made the pacing
model overshoot. It is committed alone and touches nothing else, so
`git revert` on that one commit restores upstream behaviour.
`computeTrackDelay` and `resetSyncTiming` are deliberately still in the file.
**Follow-up: confirm whether audio drifts on long streams.**

### DASH source pairs

| | |
|---|---|
| Commit | `feat(streaming): stream DASH video+audio pairs…` |
| Files | `voice/voice-bot.ts`, `voice/streaming/types.ts`, `packages/sidecar/main.go` |

YouTube caps progressive formats at 720p, so `-f best` made the 1080p preset
unreachable. yt-dlp is now asked for `bestvideo+bestaudio`, and the two URLs
travel to the sidecar as one string joined by `|||` (`SOURCE_SEPARATOR` in
TypeScript, `sourceSeparator` in Go — **a wire format between two processes;
change both together**). `dynamic_range=SDR` is pinned because HDR tone-maps
badly through VAAPI.

`validSource` was extended to validate each segment separately and cap the
count at two. Upstream hardened it to accept only http(s) URLs specifically so
a source could not smuggle an FFmpeg flag; because it inspects the whole
string and the split happens later, `https://ok|||-flag` would otherwise have
passed. **When merging upstream changes to `validSource`, preserve the
per-segment loop.**

### Streaming presets

| | |
|---|---|
| Commit | `feat(streaming): default to 1080p and raise its bitrate to 5500k` |
| Files | `voice/streaming/types.ts`, `prisma/schema.prisma`, `voice/voice-bot-manager.ts` |

`DEFAULT_PRESET` 720p → 1080p; the 1080p preset's bitrate 4500k → 5500k (VP9
was visibly blocky on high-motion content at the old figure).

No migration accompanies the schema default: this deployment applies schema
with `prisma db push` on container start (`Dockerfile.backend`), and the
committed `migrations/` directory is a single one-off patch, not a replayable
history — `prisma migrate diff` cannot even replay it. **Schema changes in this
fork go through `db push`; do not add migration files.**

1440p and 2160p presets were added alongside, and the default is a setting
rather than a constant. The defect carried through the import — that
`startVideoStream` ignored `this.config.streamPreset`, so the per-bot column
was written by the UI and never read — is fixed: precedence is the caller,
then the bot's own column, then the configured default, with an unknown key
warning and falling back rather than failing the stream.

### Idle stream auto-stop

| | |
|---|---|
| Commit | `feat(streaming): auto-stop a video stream left with no viewers` |
| Files | `voice/voice-bot.ts` |

A stream with no viewers stops itself after five minutes; a viewer joining
cancels the countdown. An encode runs whether or not anyone is watching, so an
abandoned stream otherwise held a GPU encode session open indefinitely.

### Streams created public

| | |
|---|---|
| Commit | `feat(streaming): create video streams as public` |
| Files | `voice/streaming/stream-signaling.ts`, `voice/voice-bot.ts` |

`accessibility` is forced to `0` in `StreamSignaling`, **overriding whatever
the caller passed**. On a private server every member should be able to watch
any bot stream, and the upstream default was turning away viewers who were
entitled to watch.

Resolved. `StreamSignaling` honours the caller's `accessibility` again, and
the decision is made in `VoiceBot` from the `streamPublic` setting, still
defaulting to public.

### Bot speaks English

| | |
|---|---|
| Commit | `i18n(bot): speak English in TeamSpeak instead of French` |
| Files | `voice/music-command-handler.ts` |

Upstream's bot replies were a mix of French and English. All 39 user-visible
strings and the `!help` table are English. `«guillemets»` became `"straight
quotes"` (the French marks render inconsistently across TeamSpeak client
fonts), column padding was re-aligned for English label widths, and the French
aliases `!aide` and `!paroles` were dropped.

Resolved. `voice/bot-i18n/` holds one catalogue per language (English,
Finnish, French, German, Spanish, Italian), selected by a stored setting.
Every catalogue is typed `BotMessages`, so a key added to one and forgotten
elsewhere is a compile error; `messages(lang)` falls back to English for an
unknown value, because it comes from a database column.

Typing the keys surfaced a latent bug: `QueueItem.artist` is optional and was
interpolated directly, so a track with no artist metadata replied "Now
playing: undefined - Title".

### Live TV (`!tv`)

| | |
|---|---|
| Commit | `feat(bot): watch live TV from an M3U playlist with !tv` |
| Files | `voice/iptv.ts`, `voice/iptv.test.ts`, `voice/music-command-handler.ts` |

`!tv` lists channels, `!tv <name>` starts one, `!tv reload` refetches. Names
match loosely (spaces stripped) so `!tv mtv3` finds `MTV 3`. The playlist is
parsed once and cached for the process.

**Deviation from the fork as deployed:** the original hardcoded the playlist
URL — a private LAN address — and a ten-entry channel whitelist as module
constants. They were first moved to environment variables, and now live in the
`StreamSettings` row with an enable toggle and a channel sort order, editable
in the web UI. A private network address stays out of a public repository's
permanent history either way.

The URL is deliberately **not** passed through `validateUrl`: that helper's
SSRF guard refuses private addresses, and the expected deployment is an IPTV
proxy on the LAN. The command never accepts a URL from a TeamSpeak user — only
a name from the parsed list. Scheme, a 15s timeout and a 5 MB body cap are
enforced instead.

### Smaller changes

| Change | Commit | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Radio stations ordered by id | `fix(bot): list radio stations…` | `!radio <id>` means ids are what users type; alphabetical order renumbered them on every insert |
| `python3` + `build-essential` in base images | `build(docker): install a native-module toolchain…` | node-gyp builds `@discordjs/opus`, `cpu-features`, `ssh2` at install time |

### Settings, and the dependency fixes

The hardcoded values above are now a `StreamSettings` row, edited in
Settings → Streaming: hardware encoding and its device, the encoder profile,
the default preset, stream visibility, and the IPTV playlist, filter and sort.
The bot's language sits with the other bot settings in Settings → Music
Commands.

Encoder selection reaches the sidecar in the `POST /source` body rather than
its environment. This is not a style choice: in a container deployment the
sidecar is long-lived and its env is fixed at container start, so a setting
changed in the web UI could not reach it any other way.

Separately, `pnpm audit --audit-level high` was failing with 13 advisories —
all of them already red on `main`, but GitHub Actions was disabled on the fork
so nothing had reported it. Every one had a published fix, so they were
resolved with version bumps and overrides rather than added to
`auditConfig.ignoreGhsas`.

## Open follow-ups

1. **Confirm the refactored encoder path still drives the GPU.** The hardware
   question is settled: VP9 VAAPI encoding has run in production on a UGREEN
   NASync DXP4800 Plus since 2026-08, with `devices: /dev/dri:/dev/dri` and
   `group_add: "105"`, streaming both IPTV and YouTube. The GPU is capable and
   the passthrough config is known good.

   What is *not* confirmed is the path this fork now takes to reach it. The
   deployed version hardcoded `vp9_vaapi`; `main` selects it through the
   encoder registry, the `/capabilities` probe and the `POST /source` body.
   Same destination, different plumbing — so a failure after upgrading is a
   code regression against a known-good reference, not a hardware unknown.

   **Upgrading from the pre-settings version silently disables hardware
   encoding.** `StreamSettings` defaults to `hwAccelEnabled: false` and
   `vp8_software` — correct for a fresh install on a host with no GPU, wrong
   for a deployment that was already using the GPU. After deploying, set
   hardware encoding on, the device to `/dev/dri/renderD128`, and the encoder
   to VP9 (VAAPI) in Settings → Streaming, or streams quietly fall back to
   software.

   Verify with the sidecar log on the first stream: `[FFmpeg] Starting: …
   encoder=vp9_vaapi`. Anything else means the fallback fired, and the line
   above it says why.

2. VP9 keyframe detector, to restore the per-peer stream gate for VP9. (VP8
   streams gate correctly again.)
3. Confirm whether removing A/V pacing causes audio drift on long streams.
4. H.264 profiles. The registry has no entry: the RTP handling and keyframe
   detection in `main.go` are VP8/VP9 shaped, and a profile that negotiates
   but never renders would be worse than its absence.
